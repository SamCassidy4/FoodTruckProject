## Lessons Learned
I learned that I may not have the actual art of coding down but I have a strong understanding of how many of these methods we use work. Many of my mistakes I found my self committing, I had the correct concept but had used the wrong names or syntax. I learned I must practice more outside of class with personal projects to really hone my skills that I am learning. I learned how personally I view things as a whole picture rather than small parts. Coding requires me to view all the small parts and intricacies in order to get the concepts correct. I learned more about how constructors work and how the computer really does help you along when trying to tackle some of these topics.
